 ChatGPT Creating a website involves multiple steps, and Python can be used for the backend logic. For web development in Python, a popular choice is to use a web framework. One of the commonly used frameworks is Flask. Here's a simple example to get you started:
pip install Flask
from flask import Flask, render_template

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def home():
    return render_template('index.html')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Your Website</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to Your Website!</h1>
</body>
</html>
python app.py
Your website will be accessible at http://127.0.0.1:5000/ in your web browser.

This is a very basic example. For a more sophisticated web application, you might want to explore additional features like routing, database integration, and more. If you plan to build larger applications, Django is another popular web framework in Python that provides more features out of the box.

Remember that deploying a website for public access involves additional steps such as choosing a hosting provider, configuring a web server, and handling security considerations.
